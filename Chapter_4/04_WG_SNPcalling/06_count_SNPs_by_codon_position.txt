# Extract codon position information from the annotated VCF file
# This example assumes that the codon position is annotated in the INFO field of the VCF file, as "ANN"
# "ANN" annotation format typically has the codon position as the 12th field in the "|" delimited list

grep -v "^#" variants_snpeff.vcf | \ # Filter out VCF header lines
cut -f8 | \ # Extract the INFO field
grep -oP 'c\.\d+' | \ # Extract codon mutation positions (e.g., c.1424)
cut -d. -f2 | \ # Isolate the numeric codon position (e.g., 1424)
awk '{print $1 % 3 == 0 ? 3 : $1 % 3}' | \ # Convert to codon position 1, 2, or 3
sort | \ # Sort the codon positions
