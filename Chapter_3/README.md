## Chapter 3: Phenotypic traits variation is similar within and between five _Pleurotus_ species

In this folder, I have two RStudio Rmd files that I used for all my analysis.

`Ex1_colordistance_import.Rmd` was used to calculate RGB values of each sample and the total sporocarp size. The objects created here were then imported into the R workspace for the subsequent analysis in the other Rmd file.

`Ex1_final_data_20241007_tidier.Rmd` contains all the code from data wrangling and statistical hypothesis testing of this chapter.
