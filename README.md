# Uniformity is a myth : insights from Aotearoa New Zealand _Pleurotus_ on intraspecific variation in fungal genotypes and phenotypes.
This reposity holds various code snippets and scripts used for data analysis and bioinformatics in my 2024 PhD thesis. Within each directory is a brief overview of chapter contents and details about each of the tools used. 

For a brief outline of chapter contents:
## Chapter 2: Multi-gene phylogeny of _Pleurotus_ in Aotearoa New Zealand supports an indigenous clade of _P. pulmonarius_
Here I've included scripts used for _in silico_ extraction of ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2 and Tef gene regions from whole genome assemblies of NZ _Pleurotus_ specimens sequenced in this study, as well as international _Pleurotus_ genomes from NCBI.

## Chapter 3: Phenotypic trait variation is similar within and between five _Pleurotus_ species
Here I've included R scripts used for data handling of phenotypic trait measurements and statistical analyses of the results.

## Chapter 4: Low genome-wide intraspecific variation and high mating type variation reveal local panmixia of _Pleurotus purpureo-olivaceus_ in South Island of Aotearoa New Zealand 
I employed various bioinformatics approaches to assemble and analyse whole genome data of _P. purpureo-olivaceus_.
